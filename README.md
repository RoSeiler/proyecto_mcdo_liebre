HMTL/CSS
Despite how complex websites and apps may be, they are still built with the fundamental blocks of the web: HTML & CSS. These languages are renowned for being 
beginner-friendly and I started to understand and design a website. Learning how to code allows me to bring out my personality on my own website, enables me to stand out 
from the crowd, contribute to projects better, helps me understand and explore other languages and provides me with an opportunity to transition into a different career.

In this little project I was practising and studying this languages taking my first steps in the implementation of a web page. ðŸ¤­
